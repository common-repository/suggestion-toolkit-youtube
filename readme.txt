== Description ==

This plugin is an extension for [Suggestion Toolkit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/related-posts-with-relevanssi/). It allows to include YouTube video suggestions into suggestion blocks on your WordPress blog or website.
Suggestions include configured number of YouTube video thumbs with titles. Mouse click on a video thumb opens video in a popup window.

== !!! IMPORTANT !!! ==
Pay attention, that by default Google allows 100 free YouTube searches via YouTube API per day, so pay attention how many unique blocks you are creating and what cache times you are setting.
Once free requests will be used, YouTube suggestions will no longer be added to generated suggestions till the next day. Sure you always can purchase additional requests from [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
